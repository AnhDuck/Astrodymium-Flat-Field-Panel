# Astrodymium Flat Field Panel

### Changes from MK2:

1. Removed recommendation to use PWM style dimmers since they increase flicker/scan lines. This issue is solved by stacking more diffusing material (to increase exposure length) which has been made much easier to do with the newer design
2. Now includes an integrated diffuser (0.25mm frosted/opaque plastic) to reduce flicker and increase light uniformity
3. Significantly cleaner design as a result of relocating half the screws to the bottom of the panel
4. Increased diameter from 150mm to 160mm for better compatibility with more telescope dew shields
5. Added thicker walls and a wider central post which makes the panel have no flex

Features: 

* Modular design allows quick swapping of the bottom plate for use with different diffuser materials
* Compact and integrated design (EL power supply is housed inside)
* Easy assembly process and very little support material required
* 3 cable management clips ensure no wires are dangling during storage
