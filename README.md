# Changelogs: 

### MK2 -> MK3:

1. Removed recommendation to use PWM style dimmers since they increase flicker/scan lines. This issue is solved by stacking more diffusing material (to increase exposure length) which has been made much easier to do with the newer design
2. Significantly cleaner design as a result of relocating half the screws to the bottom of the panel
3. Increased diameter from 150mm to 160mm for better compatibility with more telescope dew shields
4. Added thicker walls and a wider central post which makes the panel have no flex

### Future changes for MK3.X (name for update is still pending)

1. An integrated diffuser will be added (0.25mm frosted plastic) to reduce light output, because the standard brightness is too much for most optical setups. In theory this should improve the quality of the flats as well, since the light will be more evenly spread out.
2. Size of the housing will be decreased for less filament usage. This will also require a redesign of the cable management clips.
3. The illuminated diameter has been increased from 110mm to 115mm.
